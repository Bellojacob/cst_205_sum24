For lab 2, we are tasked to represent RGB color values in python. For this I
created a python script to allow the user to enter an RGB color combination,
and using conditionals, python will determine what the dominate primary color
is within the color specified. Some of the colors I experiemented with in part
one were, (247,59,109) Reddish, (30,222,243) Blueish, (72,243,30) Greenish.
Then for part 2, if two color channels are equal, we determine what the color
is, and print out the color combination. The color combinations I experimented
with are the ones from the document, (250,250,70) yellow, (245,50,245) purple,
(100,231,231) cyan. 

A major issue I encountered was due to my poor python experience. When writing
my code, my conditionals would not print anything out, I spent about 20
minutes trying to debug my code and figure out what I did wrong and losing my
sanity. I eventually turn to ChatGPT to ask what I was doing wrong, and my
conditionals would not execute because they were being read as strings instead
of ints, so I had to type cast them in my tuple.
