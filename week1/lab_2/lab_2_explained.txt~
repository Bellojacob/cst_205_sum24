For lab 2, we are tasked to represent RGB color values in python. For this I
created a python script to allow the user to enter an RGB color combination,
and using conditionals, python will determine what the dominate primary color
is within the color specified. Some of the colors I experiemented with in part
one were, (247,59,109) Reddish, (30,222,243) Blueish, (72,243,30) Greenish.
Then for part 2, if two color channels are equal, we determine what the color
is, and print out the color combination.
