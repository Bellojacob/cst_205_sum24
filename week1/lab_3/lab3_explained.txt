For lab 3, our first task is to create a dictionary containing key:value pairs
of colors. Then we use our key to access the values and print out some
sentences. Then we practice accessing other tuple items within a dictionary in
code that is given to us. Then we create a function that receives user input
and uses string literals to return a string of their rgb color. Next we allow
the user to enter a tuple as an arguments and we print their individual rgb
values. Then our last two functions, we convert from rgb to hex and then hex
to rgb.
