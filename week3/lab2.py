"""
This class represents an image object.  To create
:py:class:`~PIL.Image.Image` objects, use the appropriate factory
functions.  There's hardly ever any reason to call the Image constructor
directly.

#   Task 3
from PIL import Image

"""
You can attach auxiliary information to an image using the info attribute.
This is a dictionary object.  How such information is handled when loading 
and saving image files is up to the file format handler 
(see the chapter on Image file formats). 
Most handlers add properties to the info attribute 
when loading an image, but ignore it when saving images.
